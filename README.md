## Objectives of this project:
- Study of classical computer vision algorithms, as well as work with artificial neural networks;
- Optimization of these algorithms on ARM architectures. The study of parallel programming. Using Vector instructions;
- Working with Raspberry PI devices in practice.

## Software modules:
### Module 1. 
A module for generating data/reading images and storing images. The Image class is independent when reading format images `.bmp` (`OpenCV` library is used for other formats).
### Module 2. 
The algorithms module. At the moment, it contains the following matrix multiplication algorithms: classical multiplication,multiplication using OpenMP and Neon_intrinsics
### Module 3. 
The test module. In development...
###Module 4. The Benchmarks module. In development...
